# Project Euler 012 - Highly Divisible Triangular Numbers

The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers.  So the 7th triangle number would be `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28`.

The first ten terms would be:

`1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45. 55, ...`

Let us list the factors of the first seven triangle numbers:

      1: 1
      3: 1,3
      6: 1,2,3,6
     10: 1,2,5,10
     15: 1,3,5,15
     21: 1,3,7,21
     28: 1,2,4,7,14,28

We can see that 28 is the first triangle number to have over 5 divisors.

What is the value of the first triangle number to have over n divisors (e.g. 500)?  The aim is to answer this question using HTML Forms and JavaScript.

## UX

**Getting Started**

Enter a whole number between 1 and 1000 in the input field and click on the Submit Button.  You will see the number you have entered as well as the first triangle number to have over n divisors, unless you have made an invalid input.  For example, if you entered 5, you should get 28 as the first triangle number to have over n divisors.  Click on the Reset Button to clear that information or to start again.

**User Stories**

As a user, I expect to get an invalid input if I do any of:

* Not enter anything in the input field
* Entering text that is not a number (e.g. bus)
* Entering a number less than 1 or greater than 1000
* Entering a number, but it is not an integer

As a user, I expect the function `divisibleTriangleNumber(5)` to return a number.

As a user, I expect the function `divisibleTriangleNumber(5)` to return 28.

As a user, I expect the function `divisibleTriangleNumber(23)` to return 630.

As a user, I expect the function `divisibleTriangleNumber(167)` to return 1385280.

As a user, I expect the function `divisibleTriangleNumber(374)` to return 17907120.

As a user, I expect the function `divisibleTriangleNumber(500)` to return 76576500.

**Information Architecture**

The function `divisibleTriangleNumber(n)` returns a number, where `n` is the number of divisors between 1 and 1000.
